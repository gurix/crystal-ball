Abstract = {Aim of the study: The aim of the present study was to identify factors at the beginning and at the end of an inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation predicting the successful transfer of Progressive Relaxation (PR) according to Jacobson three months after the stay. Methods: Eighty patients in a psychosomatic rehabilitation center were studied in the beginning (T1), at discharge (T2) and three months after discharge (T3). Every patient participated in courses on PR. To evaluate the course, parts of the Diagnostisches und evaluatives Instrumentarium für Entspannungstraining und Entspannungstherapie were used. Transfer was defined as successful if patients practised PR at least once a week three months after their stay. Potential predictors were: diagnosis, age, symptoms, previous experiences, and motives at T1 and frequency of practising, adequateness of group size and change of symptoms at T2. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors. Results: Three months a},

The result is a reduction of several orders of magnitude in the number of operations required to find the best subsets.},
